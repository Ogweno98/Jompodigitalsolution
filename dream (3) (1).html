      <h2>Where Dreams Take Flight</h2>
      <p>
        Dream Soccer Club is a youth empowerment initiative supported by JOMPO. We use football as a tool to inspire, mentor, and educate young talents in our community. The club provides training, coaching, and life skills to children and teenagers, promoting discipline, teamwork, and resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the pitch, Dream Soccer is a family. We emphasize education, environmental awareness, and community service. Our players engage in tree planting, clean-up drives, and school outreach programs—proving that athletes can be champions on and off the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        With JOMPO's support, Dream Soccer Club has grown to include boys and girls teams, and we are proud to showcase the best players in regional and national competitions. Football is more than a game here—it’s a dream in motion.
