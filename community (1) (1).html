      <h2>Empowering People, Growing Together</h2>
      <p>
        The JOMPO community is the heartbeat of our work. We collaborate with farmers, youth, local leaders, and schools to build a sustainable future. Through forums, workshops, volunteer programs, and mentorship, we foster innovation and growth from the grassroots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our community approach is inclusiveâ€”bringing together voices from rural and urban areas, empowering women and youth, and ensuring everyone participates in decision-making. We believe in bottom-up development that respects local culture and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        From hosting climate action summits to running environmental clean-ups and football tournaments, our community initiatives aim to unite, inspire, and uplift. Join us and be part of the movement creating lasting change in Kenya and beyond.
