      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        JOMPO Digital Solutions was founded with the goal of addressing the intertwined challenges of climate change, food insecurity, and energy poverty. With a team of dedicated professionals, we provide innovative agricultural solutions, promote renewable energy adoption, and advocate for digital literacy across rural Kenya and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        We work across key thematic areas: regenerative agriculture, digital farming, renewable energy (especially solar), youth sports development, and water access through boreholes. Our holistic approach ensures communities are not only surviving but thriving in the face of environmental and economic challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining environmental conservation with entrepreneurship, JOMPO is building a model for sustainable rural development—one that’s community-led, technology-driven, and future-ready.
